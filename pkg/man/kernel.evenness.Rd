\title{Functional evenness of species or individuals in a kernel density hypervolume representing a given community.}
\usage{
kernel.evenness(comm, trait, method = "box", abund = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A hypervolume object or a list of hypervolume objects (one for each species or community) constructed with the hypervolume R package. Alternatively, a sites x species matrix, with incidence or abundance data about the species in the community.}

\item{trait}{A matrix of traits for each species in comm (a species for each row and traits as columns). Must be provided only if 'comm' is a sites x species matrix.}

\item{method}{Method for constructing the hypervolume. One of "box" (box kernel density estimation), "gaussian" (Gaussian kernel density estimation), or "svm" (one-class support vector machine). See respective functions of the hypervolume package for details. Must be provided only if 'comm' is a sites x species matrix.}

\item{abund}{A boolean (T/F) indicating whether abundance data should be used or converted to incidence before analysis. If not specified, default is FALSE. Ignored if a Hypervolume or HypervolumeList is provided as input data.}
}
\value{
A vector of evenness values for each site.
}
\description{
Functional evenness of a community, measuring the regularity of functional elements distribution within the total functional space.
}
\details{
Evenness is calculated as the overlap between the observed hypervolume and an imaginary hypervolume where traits and abundances are evenly distributed within the range of their values (Carmona et al., 2016).

\examples{
comm <- rbind(c(0,3,2,1), c(1,5,6,2), c(0,0,2,1))
rownames(comm) = c("Community_1","Community_2","Community_3")
colnames(comm) = c("Sp_1","Sp_2","Sp_3","Sp_4")
trait <- cbind(c(2.2,4.4,6.1,8.3),c(0.5,1,0.5,0.4),c(0.7,1.2,0.5,0.4))
rownames(trait) = c("Sp_1","Sp_2","Sp_3","Sp_4")
colnames(trait) = c("Trait_1","Trait_2","Trait_3")

#Example with community and trait matrices as input data
#kernel.evenness(comm = comm, trait = trait, method = "box")

#Example with hypervolume as input data
#kernel.evenness(hypervolume_box(trait))
