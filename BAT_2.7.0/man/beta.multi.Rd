\title{Beta diversity among multiple communities.}
\usage{
beta.multi(comm, tree, func = "jaccard", abund = TRUE, raref = 0, runs = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A sites x species matrix, with either abundance or incidence data.}

\item{tree}{A phylo or hclust object (used only for PD or FD) or alternatively a species x traits matrix or data.frame to build a functional tree.}

\item{func}{Indicates whether the Jaccard or Soerensen family of beta diversity measures should be used. If not specified, default is jaccard.}

\item{abund}{A boolean (T/F) indicating whether abundance data should be used (TRUE) or converted to incidence (FALSE) before analysis.}

\item{raref}{An integer specifying the number of individuals for rarefaction (individual based).
If raref < 1 no rarefaction is made.
If raref = 1 rarefaction is made by the minimum abundance among all sites.
If raref > 1 rarefaction is made by the abundance indicated.
If not specified, default is 0.}

\item{runs}{Number of resampling runs for rarefaction. If not specified, default is 100.}
}
\value{
A matrix of beta measures x diversity values (average and variance).
}
\description{
Beta diversity with possible rarefaction - multiple sites measure calculated as the average or variance of all pairwise values.
}
\details{
Beta diversity of multiple sites simultaneously is calculated as either the average or the variance among all pairwise comparisons (Legendre, 2014).
The beta diversity measures used here follow the partitioning framework independently developed by Podani & Schmera (2011) and Carvalho et al. (2012)
and later expanded to PD and FD by Cardoso et al. (2014), where Btotal = Brepl + Brich.
Btotal = total beta diversity, reflecting both species replacement and loss/gain;
Brepl = beta diversity explained by replacement of species alone;
Brich = beta diversity explained by species loss/gain (richness differences) alone.
PD and FD are calculated based on a tree (hclust or phylo object, no need to be ultrametric). The path to the root of the tree is always included in calculations of PD and FD.
The number and order of species in comm must be the same as in tree.

comm <- matrix(c(2,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,2), nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
tree <- hclust(dist(c(1:5), method="euclidean"), method="average")
beta.multi(comm)
beta.multi(comm, func = "Soerensen")
beta.multi(comm, tree)
